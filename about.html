		<section class="about">
		  <p>
		    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is an independent agency of the U.S. Federal
		    Government responsible for the civilian space program, as well as aeronautics and space
		    research.
		  </p>
		  <br />
		  <p>
		    NASA was established in 1958, succeeding the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA).
		    The new agency was to have a distinctly civilian orientation, encouraging peaceful applications
		    in space science. Since its establishment, most US space exploration efforts have been led by
		    NASA, including the Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space
		    Shuttle. NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the development of
		    the Orion spacecraft, the Space Launch System, and Commercial Crew vehicles. The agency is also
		    responsible for the Launch Services Program, which provides oversight of launch operations and
		    countdown management for uncrewed NASA launches.
		  </p>
		  <br />
		  <p>
		    NASA science is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System;
		    advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics
		    Research Program; exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic spacecraft
		    such as New Horizons; and researching astrophysics topics, such as the Big Bang, through the
		    Great Observatories and associated programs.
