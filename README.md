## General info
This was the fourth homework project on the [Superhi Foundation](https://superhi.com/courses/html-css-javascript-foundation) course. It is a redesign of the main project for the week, [Boyce](https://github.com/guybroadhurst/boyce). It introduced different forms of layout and positioning, including absolute and realative positioning. As well as introducing CSS flexbox and how to use it. The site has a couple of nice features involving hover overlays, transforming the images and adding the titles when you hover on a specific artwork.
